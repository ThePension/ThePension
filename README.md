As a software engineer student, I am a master at turning caffeine into code.

I have a love-hate relationship with debugging, but ultimately, I always find a way to fix the bugs.

I am always open to new opportunities, so if you need a coder who can make your project not only work, but also work in style, let's collaborate!
